   * Or wherever you created your original CS1580 folder.
2. Clone the assigned repository 
   > ``git clone <repo_url>``
3. Change directory to cloned repo
   > ``cd 2023-SP-A-lab0x-abcdef``
4. Start coding
   > ``nano <filename>.cpp``

## Submission Instructions
1. To git-classes
    - Save your code to your repo and submit every file in the folder - 
  
        > ``git add .``

    - Commit changes

        > ``git commit -m "<your_message>"``

    - Push to repo
  
        > ``git push``

If git-classes is not available to you, submit your code to canvas as needed.

***Screenshots of your code running is not sufficient for lab credit. You must submit your source code.***
